## Exam window

- 10/7 is the first day to start the exam
- 10/18 is the last day to start the exam
- **10/19 is the last day TO SUBMIT ASSIGNMENTS & DISCUSSIONS (Wed of Week8 not Sun of Week9!!)**

## Rules

- No help from ANYONE
- You may ask clarifying questions of an instructor or TA
- You may look things up and use resources other than people
- Only use the technology that we have taught in the class (that is what you're being tested on)
- DM **Stephanie** once you finish the exam so you are set in the grading queue
- if you are aiming for Black belt after submitting just go ahead and deploy and send the ip after
- Also make sure to submit your zip on the platform
- Don't plagiarize
- Include your pip files and the file for your ERD (without it I can't test your exam)
- You must have 15 core assignments to begin
- if you need code on week7 reach out to **Stephanie** or **Adrian** for code
- if you need

## Tips

- AIM for passing (ORANGE) (then you can take another attempt)
  - I rather grade complete app that took 21 hours (which is ORANGE) than incomplete app that is done in 4 hours (which will Fail)
- Have a working login, registration before hand
- Have a list of the variables and their locations that you will need to change to accommodate any difference in the exam
- Have your schema up and ready to be modified (remember to drop schema when you forward engineer)
- Test a lot, looking in your terminal and the browser errors.
- Know your data
- Match your routes to those listed on the exam exactly
- Complete Recipes assignment first
- When you open the exam,compare the two wireframes and determine if you will go after the red or black from the beginning
- Getting a pass to start with, before attempting the red or black takes a lot of pressure off and better prepares you for the red or black

## Remember

- **SAVE ERD FILE IN THE FOLDER STRUCTURE**
- You still need your attendance and assignments to pass
- You have 24 hours
- Communicate with me so that we can be efficient
